These programs for 8 bit computers ATARI XL/XE were meant like playing with Kyan Pascal and plotter XY4150. They were made sometime around 1992.

Files xy4150.i.txt and zelvxy.i.txt are includes and contain procedures for controlling plotter.

Program **hilbxy.p.txt** draws Hilbert’s curves. Number H0 depends on the order of curve:

H0min=2 (3 + N)

where N is the order of curve, and must be divisible by 2. Due to step of plotter – 0.1 mm is H0 = 1024 in program to receive enough large drawing.

Hilbert’s curves 1., 2. and 3. order:

The output of program hilbxy.p.txt is picture with combined Hilbert’s curves 1. - 5. order:

Program **sierpxy.p.txt** draws Sierpinsky’s curves. Number N means the order of curve, number H0 has the same meaning like upper.

Sierpinski’s curves of 1., 2. and 3. order

The output of program  sierpxy.p.txt  is combination of curves 1 – 4. order:

Program **vlocka.p.txt** draws Snowflakes:

Program **drakxy.p.txt** draws a “dragon”:

Program **chalupy.p.txt** draws a tree which consists of simple cottages:
